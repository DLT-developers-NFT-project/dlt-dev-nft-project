## Description of the Project Ainhoa

Background:  DLT Talents Program aims to empower women to get into blockchain technology, become leaders and build the basis for a successful career in this quickly evolving ecosystem.  The program does not offer lectures or exams. It is couch oriented, and for 18 weeks and bi-weekly online sessions encourages females to become entrepreneurs, technologies, regulators, investors or multiplicators in this field. 

The success of the program relies on the self-driven motivation, work, and effort of each of the participants. The program encourages networking between participants, study groups and collaboration. It also insists on trying the technology firsthand, to put it in to practice, to get in contact with real experts in the field. 

Proposal:  The creation of a NFT Game that aims to: 

1.	From the development-process perspective:

- serve as a real case practice to learn from firsthand how to code and develop a real DApp. 
- be a real case of collaboration between DLT Talents of Spring 2021. 

2.	From the product perspective: 

- allow future DLT Talents to interact with a real DApp in a test environment. 
- improve engagement, collaboration, and interaction between DLT Talents.
- encourage DLT Talents to complete bi-weekly assignments with a reward system.
- bring gamification to DLT learning path.


## Rules - Khawla

### Short Description 

1. Gamification of DLT Talents: to interact with different talents. 

   - every talent recieves an animal 
   - the animal needs to be fed with interaction
   - whenever there is an interaction, based on the intensity, length, you merge different types of bodies/DNA
   - e.g. for a comment you get a toe, for a phone call a hand etc., group call color mix
   - goal is to have the most crazy looking animal (most fantastic)


### Details
- Attributes for Octopus
   - Color
   - size
   - no. of tentacles
   - pattern
   - Accessories (maybe) for the categories 
      - bow - lawyer
      - hat - entrpeneur
      - sunglasses 

- Frontend
   - hosted on Netlifly
   - set up Vue project
   - put 
   - as simple as possible
   - card (token)


- Rules of the Game
   - everybody gets an octopus without legs in a random color (name *  key/id)
   - three options (buttons)
   - finished an assignment (1 leg grows)
   - interacting with someone else (add color: own color * partner color * key) 
      button - i interacted with : input :hash of partner (partner has to confirm it)
      to verify the interaction you have to add add least 200 - 400 words 
      > leads to the creation of a new octopus
   - choose your specfification  (depending on the topic you get an accessory) 
   - Goal: biggest, most fäncy army 


- Smart Contract
   - example Crypto Kitties
   - resting time for assignment equals time between sessions (2 weeks)
   - resting time for interaction (20 min)
   - specialisation after (lesson 6 , specification time)

- Backend
   - needs to store the NFTs

- Design
   - is easy to automate random combinations of the octopus

Rinkeby testnetwork!!!
Example to the video on [GitHub](https://github.com/jklepatch/eattheblocks/tree/master/dapp-30/day24-cryptokitty-collectible-game)… I mean similar but crypto kitties

## Question:
- is this possible to do in a testnet - Rinkeby
- We need a loging page -Authentication ? - only Metamask!! - Lena



## Future ideas: 
2. Markeplace/ Platform where you can aquire a part/layer/percentage of a NFT : very diverse usecases, can applied to DeFi, art, marketing
