## Description of the Project Ainhoa

Background:  DLT Talents Program aims to empower women to get into blockchain technology, become leaders and build the basis for a successful career in this quickly evolving ecosystem.  The program does not offer lectures or exams. It is couch oriented, and for 18 weeks and bi-weekly online sessions encourages females to become entrepreneurs, technologies, regulators, investors or multiplicators in this field. 

The success of the program relies on the self-driven motivation, work, and effort of each of the participants. The program encourages networking between participants, study groups and collaboration. It also insists on trying the technology firsthand, to put it in to practice, to get in contact with real experts in the field. 

Proposal:  The creation of a NFT Game that aims to: 

1.	From the development-process perspective:

- serve as a real case practice to learn from firsthand how to code and develop a real DApp. 
- be a real case of collaboration between DLT Talents of Spring 2021. 

2.	From the product perspective: 

- allow future DLT Talents to interact with a real DApp in a test environment. 
- improve engagement, collaboration, and interaction between DLT Talents.
- encourage DLT Talents to complete bi-weekly assignments with a reward system.
- bring gamification to DLT learning path.


## Rules - Khawla

### Short Description 

We're building an Ethereum-based gamifiction platform to motivate and reward the DLT Talents for their engagement and learnings.

   - Every talent earns crypto-collectibe octopuses by completing the tasks listed in the table below
   - Each octopus will have a unique appearance and a total of 6 attributes  
   - You'll be creating and cutomizing an octopus in addition to building an army of octopuses by unlocking the rewards and earning points after the completion of each task
   - Goal is to build the biggest and most fancy army 
   - There is a total of 4 phases in the [DLTT program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h1cnIzLQU4JSll-n-qOySaq6R9K1hHXLdF2WD4TtGhw/edit) and 8 assignments

### Details

Intially, everybody gets an octopus without any arms in a randomly generated color (name *  key/id) then based on the interactions you make during the program, you'll end up with a pretty cool octopus or even better; an army of octopuses. An interaction is defined by the following tasks:

<center>

| ID | Task                                                                                              	| Reward          	|

|1 | Helping talents with the assignments  (answering questions, providing helpful resources,  ...etc) 	| Color Mix       	|
|2 | Having a group call, initiating an activity, chatting, or working in teams                                                                                               	|   Growth in  size	|

|6 | Publishing a Medium article - Phase #4 of the program                                                                      	                        | Suction cups    	|

## Development Details

- Frontend
   - hosted on Netlifly
   - set up Vue project
   - put 
   - as simple as possible
   - card (token)

- Smart Contract
   - example Crypto Kitties
   - resting time for assignment equals time between sessions (2 weeks)
   - resting time for interaction (30 min)
   - specialisation after (lesson 6 , specification time)

- Backend
   - needs to store the NFTs

- Design
   - is easy to automate random combinations of the octopus

## Question:
- is this possible to do in a testnet - Rinkeby
- We need a loging page -Authentication ? - only Metamask!! - Lena



## Future ideas: 
2. Markeplace/ Platform where you can aquire a part/layer/percentage of a NFT : very diverse usecases, can applied to DeFi, art, marketing
