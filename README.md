## Description of the Project Ainhoa

- why are we doing FT and gamification: it's fun, easy to interest people, bring them closer to the topic in a playfull way
- encouragement 
- interaction between participants
- reward system (completing tasks)


## Rules - Khawla

### Short Description 

1. Gamification of DLT Talents: to interact with different talents. 

   - every talent recieves an animal 
   - the animal needs to be fed with interaction
   - whenever there is an interaction, based on the intensity, length, you merge different types of bodies/DNA
   - e.g. for a comment you get a toe, for a phone call a hand etc., group call color mix
   - goal is to have the most crazy looking animal (most fantastic)


### Details
- Attributes for Octopus
   - Color
   - size
   - no. of tentacles
   - pattern
   - Accessories (maybe) for the categories 
      - bow - lawyer
      - hat - entrpeneur
      - sunglasses 

- Frontend
   - hosted on Netlifly
   - set up Vue project
   - put 
   - as simple as possible
   - card (token)


- Rules of the Game
   - everybody gets an octopus without legs in a random color (name *  key/id)
   - three options (buttons)
   - finished an assignment (1 leg grows)
   - interacting with someone else (add color: own color * partner color * key) 
      button - i interacted with : input :hash of partner (partner has to confirm it)
      to verify the interaction you have to add add least 200 - 400 words 
      > leads to the creation of a new octopus
   - choose your specfification  (depending on the topic you get an accessory) 
   - Goal: biggest, most fäncy army 


- Smart Contract
   - example Crypto Kitties
   - resting time for assignment equals time between sessions (2 weeks)
   - resting time for interaction (20 min)
   - specialisation after (lesson 6 , specification time)

- Backend
   - needs to store the NFTs

- Design
   - is easy to automate random combinations of the octopus

The [Non-Fungible Token Bible](https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/): Everything you need to know about NFTs



## Question:
- is this possible to do in a testnet - Rinkeby
- We need a loging page -Authentication ? - only Metamask!! - Lena



## Future ideas: 
2. Markeplace/ Platform where you can aquire a part/layer/percentage of a NFT : very diverse usecases, can applied to DeFi, art, marketing
