Hej and welcome we are super happy to see you joining our group

Before we start coding we need to install and also get used to some tools and programms we will be using a lot.
This tutorial is here to help you to get started and to find some resources that will make you comfortable with these tools.

First of all you will need to install `git`. This is a programm that will help you interact with software like GitHub and Gitlab but foremost will help you to do version control on the code you write. This is very helpfull when you are working on code on your own and maby need to reverse some changes, as you will always update and reorganize your code. But more importantly it is to organize the changes of a whole team. It is also the main version control tool that is used in companies. So if you are planning to become a blockchain developer, you should be comfortable using it. To actually open the code and edit it we will install [Visual Studio Code]().

But before we get started you need to get comfortable with your terminal. Of course you could do most of these actions over a GUI (Graphical User Interface) but for some actions you will need to use your terminal and for that it is really good to get comfortable using it.

When I am using capital letters it means that it is just the placeholder for a specific variable that should be writen there in your specific case.

This tutorial will give you an introduction on how to use these tools. But everything that is explained here is common practice used in tech companies. So if you want to apply for a job, having all of theses bases covered will make you more interesting as a possible candidate. As some copmpanies don't have the time and the money to give you this basic training. For this kind of training they are actually counting like 3 month just to teach you all of this. So taking part in this project and learning these tools will be a great step towards becoming a programmer.

# Command Line

You will see the abreviation CLI a lot. It means Command Line Interface

First you would open your Terminal. You should now be located in your `NAME_OF_YOUR_MACHINE/User` directory, it could also be `NAME_OF_YOUR_MACHINE/USER_NAME`. You will recognize that you are in yur home directory as well when you see this `~`sign.

From here you will install the software you will need, if I don't tell you that you need to navigate to a specific folder to do that.

Learning how to navigate through your computer will give you a better feeling of the layers in your machine. It will also save you a lot of time once you are getting used to using your keyboard more. And you also look like a hacker and feel super cool.

Something I learned along the way is that you don't save your coding projects on your Desktop. First it is really messy and second of all if you really mess up it could destroy some of your data.

So the first thing you will do is to set up a directory that is placed in your home directory, on the same level as your `Desktop` directory.

Okay. So this is going to be maybe your first command in the command line

```
mkdir Developer
```

mkdir means "make directory"

You just created a directory with the name "Developer".
To navigate into this directory you can write in the command line

```
cd Developer
```

cd means "change directory"

to get back to the home directory you can just write in the command line

```
cd ..
```

if you get super lost and just want to get back to the home directory you could also write

```
 cd ~
```

last command I think is super helpful is

```
ls -a
```

it will give you a list of all files and directories that are in the directory you are currently in. This helps you to get an overview where you could navigate to, but also lets you easily copy the name of the directory you want to navigat to.

# Git

## setting up Git

So lets get started with `git`

if you haven't installed it yet and also don't have set up you ssh key do the following steps. Otherwise you can jump to the next subchapter.

## setting up a git project

# Visual Studio Code
